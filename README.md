# MVA_projects_TPs

The MVA (Mathematics, Vision, Learning) is Master of Research dedicated to AI and Computer Vision. It takes place at ENS Paris-Saclay, in cooperation with several French Universities and Grandes Ecoles.
Here are some of the projects I did at the MVA, which I've followed as part of my engineering studies at Télécom Paris.

## Computational statistics

An overview of statistical computational methods and bayesian inference.
You'll find:
* 4 TPs (in French or English) with various exercises about Markov Chains, EM algorithms and Metropolis-Hasting samplers.
* An analysis of the paper "Online EM Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models" from Olivier Cappé with an implementation of the algorithm.

## ALTEGRAD

An overview of sota ML and AI methods for text and graph data.
You'll find:
* 7 TPs with reports and codes
* One project with report, slides and code. The project is a Kaggle challenge about a missing link prediction task with NLP-based and GNN-based methods. More on the corresponding folder. 

## Object recognition

An introductory overview of the image, object and scene models, as well as the methods and algorithms, to address automated object recognition.
Alongside with some TPs, you'll also find a report and some slides on the STCN's algorithm for Video Segmentation. We've replicates some of the results of the paper, as well as analysing the performances on another dataset and the pros/cons of the algorithm.

## Image denoising
This course addresses the separation of noise and images. The first part of the course focused on classical image denoising theory and on deep learning methods. You'll find the hand-ons on DL methods. 

## Challenge ENS
Each year, the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) organizes maching learning challenges on various topics and hand-in-hand with public and private companies (https://challengedata.ens.fr/). As part of the "Information and Complexity" course, I've participated in the CFM's challenge on the prediction of missing bid-ask spreads. You'll find my report (in English) and some slides (in French). I've conducted a review of the literature on the imputation task and implemented and try some of the missing values imputation algorithms.

## Audio Signal Processing
Signal Processing course on audio signals. As part of the course, I've implemented and tested some Time-Scaling Phase-Vocoder algorithms (namely PV-TSM, phase-locked PV-TSM and HPS-TSM).
